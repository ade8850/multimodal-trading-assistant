{% if current_positions %}
## MANAGING EXISTING POSITION
{% for position in current_positions %}
### Example for {{ position.side }} {{ position.symbol }} position

Current context:
- Position: {{ position.side }} {{ position.symbol }}
- Size: {{ position.size }} (value: {{ position.size * current_price }} USDT)
- Entry price: {{ position.entry_price }} USDT
- Current price: {{ current_price }} USDT
- Unrealized PNL: {{ position.unrealized_pnl }}
- Status: {% if position.is_in_profit() %}In Profit{% else %}In Loss{% endif %}
- Duration: {{ "%.1f"|format(position.age_hours if position.age_hours else 0) }} hours

{% if position.is_in_profit() %}
### SCENARIO: MANAGING PROFITABLE POSITION

Chart observations (hypothetical):
- Price showing signs of slowing momentum after favorable movement
- Approaching resistance (for LONG) or support (for SHORT) level
- Price structure indicates potential momentum exhaustion

Decision process:
1. Is action required? YES - protect profit from position
2. Action type: REDUCE-ONLY orders to take profit
3. Order settings:
   - Type: LIMIT
   - Direction: {% if position.side == "Buy" %}SELL{% else %}BUY{% endif %} (opposite to position)
   - Reduce_only flag: true
   - Multi-tiered approach:
     * Tier 1 (50% of position): Place at 50-60% of distance to next key level
     * Tier 2 (30% of position): Place at 70-80% of distance to next key level
     * Tier 3 (20% of position): Place at 90% of distance to next key level
   - Rationale: "Strategic profit protection with tiered approach to maximize win rate"

{% else %}
### SCENARIO: MANAGING LOSING POSITION

Chart observations (hypothetical):
- Price has moved against our position
- Original setup may have been invalidated
- Technical signals indicate continuation of adverse movement

Decision process:
1. Is action required? YES - manage losing position
2. Available options:
   - Wait (if original setup is still valid)
   - Reduce exposure with REDUCE-ONLY order
3. If deciding to reduce exposure:
   - Type: LIMIT or MARKET (depends on urgency)
   - Direction: {% if position.side == "Buy" %}SELL{% else %}BUY{% endif %} (opposite to position)
   - Reduce_only flag: true
   - Budget calculated: ({{ position.size }} * {{ current_price }}) / {{ position.leverage }} USDT (for complete closure)
   - Rationale: "Exposure reduction after original setup invalidation"
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if existing_orders %}
## EVALUATING EXISTING ORDERS
{% for order in existing_orders %}
### Example for {{ order.side }} {{ order.symbol }} order

Current context:
- Order: {{ order.side }} {{ order.symbol }}
- ID: {{ order.id }}
- Link ID: {{ order.order_link_id }}
- Price: {{ order.price }} USDT
- Current price: {{ current_price }} USDT
- Distance from current price: {{ ((order.price - current_price) / current_price * 100)|round(2) }}%
- Type: {{ "REDUCE-ONLY" if order.reduce_only else "POSITION-INCREASING" }}
- Original rationale: {{ order.strategic_context.setup_rationale if order.strategic_context else "Not available" }}

### SCENARIO: REEVALUATING ORDER VALIDITY

Chart observations (hypothetical):
- Market conditions have changed from original setup
- Target technical level may have been violated or modified
- Momentum and market structure may have changed

Decision process:
1. Is action required? EVALUATE - is the order still valid?
2. Elements to consider:
   - Is original rationale still valid?
   - Have invalidation conditions been met?
   - Is there a better opportunity?
3. Possible actions:
   - Maintain order if still valid
   - Cancel order if no longer valid:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "{{ order.id }}",
       "order_link_id": "{{ order.order_link_id }}",
       "symbol": "{{ order.symbol }}",
       "reason": "Setup invalidation: [insert specific reason based on charts]"
     }
     ```
   - Reposition order (cancel and create new one) if level has changed
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if not current_positions and not existing_orders %}
## SCENARIO: MARKET WITH NO ACTIVE POSITIONS OR ORDERS

Current context:
- No active positions or orders
- Available budget: {{ available_budget.standard }} USDT
- Current price {{ symbol }}: {{ current_price }} USDT

### EXAMPLE: EVALUATING NEW OPPORTUNITY

Chart observations (hypothetical):
- Identified primary trend from 1H and 4H timeframes
- Interesting setup on 15m/1H timeframe
- Well-defined support/resistance structure

Decision process:
1. Is action required? EVALUATE - is there a valid opportunity?
2. Elements to consider:
   - Alignment with primary trend
   - Setup quality on operational timeframe
   - Favorable risk/reward ratio
3. If opportunity is valid:
   - Type: LIMIT or MARKET (based on situation)
   - Direction: Aligned with primary trend
   - Budget: Appropriate for setup risk level
   - Take profit: Preset at significant technical levels
   - Rationale: Detailed and based on visible technical elements
