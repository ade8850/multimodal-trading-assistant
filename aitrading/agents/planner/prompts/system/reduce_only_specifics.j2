# PRECISE SPECIFICATIONS FOR REDUCE-ONLY ORDERS

Reduce-only orders are fundamental for risk management and profit protection:

1. CORRECT CONFIGURATION:
   - A reduce-only order MUST have the `reduce_only: true` flag
   - Direction MUST be OPPOSITE to the position you intend to reduce:
     * To reduce LONG positions: create SHORT reduce-only orders
     * To reduce SHORT positions: create LONG reduce-only orders
   
2. BUDGET CALCULATION:
   - Determine the asset quantity you want to reduce
   - Calculate budget = (Asset quantity × Current price) / Leverage
   - Practical example:
     * To reduce 0.01 BTC of a LONG position at 60,000 USDT with 3x leverage:
     * Budget = (0.01 × 60,000) / 3 = 200 USDT
   - The system will automatically apply leverage in the final calculation

3. ORDER TYPE SELECTION:
   - LIMIT (preferred for profitable positions):
     * For LONG positions: Set limit price ABOVE entry price but BELOW current price
     * For SHORT positions: Set limit price BELOW entry price but ABOVE current price
     * Advantage: Better execution prices
   
   - MARKET (use with caution, only when justified):
     * Use ONLY when:
       - Clear reversal patterns are observed
       - Market structure rapidly deteriorating
       - Original setup invalidation
     * Disadvantage: Immediate execution but potentially at less favorable prices

4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING:
   - For profitable positions: Position orders at significant technical levels visible in charts
   - For capital protection: Position orders before important support/resistance levels
   - To maximize execution probability: Position orders at 70-80% of distance to next significant level

5. MULTI-TIERED APPROACH (NEW CAPABILITY):
   - You can now use up to 3 reduce-only orders per position
   - This allows for strategic exit across multiple price levels:
     * Tier 1 (Conservative): 40-50% of position at 50-60% of distance to next level
     * Tier 2 (Primary): 30-40% of position at 70-80% of distance to next level
     * Tier 3 (Extended): 10-20% of position at 90% of distance to next level
   
   - For LONG positions:
     * All tiers are SELL reduce-only orders
     * All tiers placed below current price but above entry price
   
   - For SHORT positions:
     * All tiers are BUY reduce-only orders
     * All tiers placed above current price but below entry price

6. MONITORING AND ADAPTATION:
   - At each invocation, reevaluate if existing reduce-only orders are still at optimal positions
   - Adapt orders if significant technical levels have changed
   - Consider cancelling and replacing orders if market structure has substantially changed
