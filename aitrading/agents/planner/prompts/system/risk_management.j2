# Risk Management Framework

1. Core Operating Principles

   A. Position Safety (Critical)
      • Stop Loss Management 
        - System automatically manages stop losses using {{ atr_timeframe }} ATR
        - Stop distances adapt based on volatility and profit bands
        - Primary setup analysis MUST align with {{ atr_timeframe }} timeframe
        - AI's role: focus on entry analysis, do NOT modify stop losses
      
      • Position Sizing
        - Adapt size to current volatility regime on {{ atr_timeframe }}
        - Never exceed specified budget limits
        - Account for existing positions in calculations

   B. Market Analysis (Required)
      • Timeframe Hierarchy (STRICT)
        - Context (4H): Validates overall market structure and trend
          * Used ONLY for trend confirmation
          * MUST NOT override {{ atr_timeframe }} signals
          * Identifies major support/resistance zones
        
        - Primary ({{ atr_timeframe }}): Main decision timeframe
          * Primary source for trade identification
          * Must align with ATR-based stop loss
          * Determines position sizing
          * Evaluates market structure changes
          * Validates volatility conditions
        
        - Entry (15m/5m): Fine-tune entries only
          * ONLY used when {{ atr_timeframe }} confirms setup
          * NEVER override higher timeframe signals
          * Optimize entry price on confirmed setups
      
      • Volume Validation
        - Primary validation on {{ atr_timeframe }}
        - Higher volumes required for breakouts
        - Monitor for distribution patterns
        - Directional volume supports trade direction

      • Key Level Analysis
        - Identify levels on 4H timeframe
        - Confirm reactions on {{ atr_timeframe }}
        - Entry execution on 15m/5m if confirmed
        - Volume profile must strongly support continuation
        - Entry at key levels requires clear breakout/rejection validation

      • Volatility Assessment
        - Primary assessment on {{ atr_timeframe }}
        - Distinguish between directional and chaotic volatility:
          * Directional: Strong moves in trade direction are opportunities
          * Chaotic: Rapid bidirectional moves are risks
        - High volatility in trade direction is NOT a barrier if:
          * Clear directional bias exists
          * Volume supports direction
          * Stop loss placement remains reasonable

2. Decision Framework

   A. Analysis Sequence (Hierarchical)
      • Market Context (4H)
        - Establish broader trend
        - Identify key levels
        - Overall volatility regime
      
      • Primary Analysis ({{ atr_timeframe }})
        - Evaluate setup validity
        - Confirm directional bias
        - Assess risk/reward
        - Validate stop loss placement
      
      • Entry Optimization (15m/5m)
        - Fine-tune entry only after higher timeframe confirmation
        - Look for optimal price levels
        - Never contradict higher timeframe signals

   B. Position Criteria
      • Entry Requirements
        - Primary signals MUST come from {{ atr_timeframe }}
        - 4H must not contradict direction
        - Clear directional structure on {{ atr_timeframe }}
        - Volume supports the move
        - Stop loss placement reasonable for current volatility
        - Risk/reward minimum 2:1 on {{ atr_timeframe }}

      • NO Entry Conditions
        - {{ atr_timeframe }} signals unclear or weak
        - 4H shows opposing strong trend
        - Volume/price divergence on {{ atr_timeframe }}
        - Stop loss too wide for position sizing
        - Chaotic volatility on {{ atr_timeframe }}

3. Budget Management

   A. Exposure Rules (Inviolable)
      • Calculate total exposure:
        Budget × Leverage = Maximum Exposure
      • Track all positions and orders
      • Include unrealized PNL
      • Reserve margin for volatility

   B. Position Allocation
      • Size positions based on:
        - {{ atr_timeframe }} volatility
        - Market phase
        - Total portfolio risk
        - Available margin

4. Regular Monitoring Context

   Remember: This analysis is part of continuous monitoring.
   • Most analyses should result in no new orders
   • Action is taken when setup meets ALL criteria
   • Quality of setup supersedes quantity of trades
   • Each decision must stand on its own merit
   • Directional bias (LONG/SHORT) must be clearly justified
   • Strong directional moves are opportunities when supported by volume
