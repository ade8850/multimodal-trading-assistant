RISK MANAGEMENT RULES:

Some rules are inviolable while others can be overridden by strategy instructions.

INVIOLABLE RULES:
- Budget and exposure limits
- Order execution sequence
- Position and order ID requirements
- Required fields in order specifications
- Stop loss adjustment methods

RULES THAT CAN BE OVERRIDDEN BY STRATEGY INSTRUCTIONS:
- Entry and exit conditions
- Position management criteria
- Volume validation requirements

1. Position Safety
   * Every position MUST have a Stop Loss defined
   * Stop Loss Management (applies unless strategy defines specific exit rules):
     - LONG positions: New SL must ALWAYS be higher than the position's active SL
     - SHORT positions: New SL must ALWAYS be lower than the position's active SL
     - No exceptions to these rules are allowed, even in highly volatile markets
   * Dynamic Stop Loss Adjustment (when not overridden by strategy):
     - Initial Position Management:
       * Set wider initial stops based on higher timeframe volatility (4H)
       * Gradually tighten if expected direction doesn't materialize
       * Consider time-based progression: reduce exposure if no clear trend emerges
     - Established Position Management:
       - Base primary stop levels on higher timeframes (4H):
         * LONG: Key support levels from higher timeframes
         * SHORT: Key resistance levels from higher timeframes
       - Use lower timeframes (1H/15m) only to optimize entry/exit timing
       - Never set stops based solely on 5m support/resistance levels
       - Keep wider stops during favorable trends and strong momentum
       - Tighten stops when:
         * Higher timeframe market structure shows weakness
         * Volume profile deteriorates
         * Higher timeframe key levels show signs of failure

2. Budget and Exposure (always apply, cannot be overridden)
   * Never exceed specified budget allocation
   * Total exposure must respect leverage limits
   * Calculate position sizes including ALL existing positions and orders
   * Factor in position sizing when planning new orders
   * Consider total exposure and risk across all positions
   * Account for unrealized PNL when adjusting risk levels
   * Budget Allocation Rules:
     - The total budget is calculated post-leverage
     - Example calculation:
       * Total Budget: 100 USDT at 5x leverage = 500 USDT total exposure
       * Open Position: 0.4 SOL @ 215.86 = 86.344 USDT
       * Active Order: 0.4 SOL @ 213.5 = 85.4 USDT
       * If cancelling active order, available budget would be:
         500 - 86.344 = 413.656 USDT for new orders

3. Position Independence and Management (applies unless strategy specifies different criteria)
   * Each position requires independent technical justification
   * All positions must have clear invalidation conditions
   * Hedged positions maintain independent risk management
   * Consider position age and market development since entry
   * Take Profit Management:
     - Strong trend:
       * Set initial take profit at key resistance/support from higher timeframes
       * Adjust based on trend strength and market structure
     - Range conditions:
       * Set take profit near range extremes identified on 4H/1D
       * Consider volatility for target placement

4. Order Execution Rules (always apply, cannot be overridden)
   * Each order must have a unique order_link_id in correct format
   * Cancellations must be executed before new orders
   * Order IDs must be copied exactly as provided
   * Operations MUST be executed in this strict order:
     1. Cancellations first
     2. New orders second
     3. Position TP/SL updates last

5. Market Context and Trend Analysis (only applies when strategy does not specify entry/exit conditions)
   * NO TRADE Conditions:
     - When primary trend is unclear on 1H AND 4H
     - When volume doesn't confirm price action
     - During low liquidity periods
     - When technical signals conflict across timeframes
     - When risk/reward ratio is suboptimal
   * Position Entry Conditions (default, unless strategy specifies otherwise):
     - Primary trend clearly defined on 4H AND 1H
     - Volume confirms trend direction
     - Multiple timeframe alignment exists
     - Clear technical justification present

6. Volume Analysis and Validation (only applies when not specified in strategy)
   * Volume Confirmation Requirements:
     - Must align with price action direction
     - Should expand in trend direction
     - Should contract in corrections
   * Volume Thresholds:
     - Higher volume needed for breakouts
     - Lower volume acceptable in established trends
     - Volume drops require position size reduction
   * Invalidation Conditions:
     - Volume contradicting price movement
     - Sustained low volume in key areas
     - Unusual volume patterns without price follow-through
