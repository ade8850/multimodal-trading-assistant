# CYCLICAL DECISION PROCESS ({{ parameters.analysis_interval }} MINUTE INTERVAL)

## Current System State
- Open positions: {{ current_positions|length }}
- Active orders: {{ existing_orders|length }}
- Available budget: {{ available_budget.standard }} USDT
- Last invocation: {{ parameters.analysis_interval }} minutes ago

## Market Evolution Assessment
1. Significant changes since last invocation:
   - Examine market structure changes from charts
   - Evaluate price movements relative to existing positions/orders
   - Assess trend continuation or potential reversal signs

2. Decision priorities:
   {% if current_positions %}
   - HIGH: Management of existing positions, especially profitable ones
   - MEDIUM: Evaluation of active orders for potential cancellation/repositioning
   - LOW: Consideration of new opportunities
   {% elif existing_orders %}
   - HIGH: Evaluation of existing orders in updated market context
   - MEDIUM: Consideration of new opportunities
   {% else %}
   - HIGH: Evaluation of new opportunities if aligned with primary trend
   {% endif %}

3. Temporal perspective:
   - Primary operational timeframe: 15m/1H
   - Immediate actions: Managing positions/orders requiring intervention
   - Scheduled actions: Positioning limit orders at strategic levels
   - Preparation for next invocation in {{ parameters.analysis_interval }} minutes

## Continuity Considerations
- Current decisions will influence system state at next invocation
- Position strategic limit orders that might execute before next invocation
- Use reduce-only orders to automatically protect profits
- Consider how market might evolve in the next {{ parameters.analysis_interval }} minutes

# MICRO-SWING OPTIMIZATION FOR {{ parameters.analysis_interval }} MINUTE INTERVAL

With {{ parameters.analysis_interval }} minute invocation interval, optimize your trading approach:

1. ACTION TIMING:
   - Each decision is part of a continuous process
   - Not every invocation requires action
   - DO NOTHING is often the optimal strategy
   - Only take action when technical signals clearly warrant it

2. ORDER TYPE SELECTION:
   - For position entries requiring immediate execution: MARKET orders
   - For predetermined levels where price may reach: LIMIT orders
   - For profit protection: Multiple REDUCE-ONLY orders at strategic levels

3. REDUCE-ONLY OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use multiple reduce-only orders (up to 3) to create a cascading exit strategy
   - Position these at technical levels visible in the charts
   - This creates automatic profit protection between invocations

4. BETWEEN-INTERVAL STRATEGY:
   - Anticipate where price could move before next invocation
   - Place orders at levels that could be reached within {{ parameters.analysis_interval }} minutes
   - Use limit orders to automate execution at optimal levels
   - Ensure all orders have clear invalidation conditions for next check
