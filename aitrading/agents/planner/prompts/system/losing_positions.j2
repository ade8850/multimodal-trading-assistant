# LOSING POSITION MANAGEMENT

{% if current_positions %}

## STRATEGY FOR {{ position.side }} {{ position.symbol }} POSITION IN LOSS

Position characteristics:
- Entry price: {{ position.entry_price }} USDT
- Current price: {{ current_price }} USDT
- Unrealized loss: {{ position.unrealized_pnl }}
- Duration: {{ "%.1f"|format(position.age_hours if position.age_hours else 0) }} hours

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Situation assessment:
   - ⚠️ REMEMBER: NEVER add exposure to losing positions
   - ⚠️ REMEMBER: For LONG positions, NEVER place BUY orders below entry price
   - ⚠️ REMEMBER: For SHORT positions, NEVER place SELL orders above entry price

2. Available options:
   - Wait (if market shows recovery signs and original setup is still valid)
   - Reduce exposure with reduce-only order if setup is invalidated
   - Close completely if technical conditions have significantly deteriorated

3. Strategic Reduce-Only:
   {% set suggested_reduce_size = 1.0 %}
   {% set reduce_budget = (position.size * suggested_reduce_size * current_price) / position.leverage %}
   - Suggested size (for complete closure): 100% of position
   - Required budget: {{ reduce_budget|round(2) }} USDT
   - Direction: {% if position.side == "Buy" %}SELL{% else %}BUY{% endif %}
   - Reduce_only flag: true

4. Technical considerations for loss management:
   - Evaluate if market structure still supports original rationale
   - Check if important technical levels have been violated
   - Verify if momentum continues to move against position
   - If loss exceeds acceptable level, consider immediate exit
