Order ID and Link ID Requirements:
- For NEW orders:
  * Each order must have a unique order_link_id
  * Format MUST be: "{plan_id}-{session_id}-{order_number}"
  * Example: For plan_id "{{ plan_id }}", session_id "{{ session_id }}" and first order: "{{ plan_id }}-{{ session_id }}-1"
  * The order_number must match the order's id field
  * Order IDs must be progressive starting from 1
- For CANCELLATIONS:
  * Always copy the exact order ID from the active orders list
  * Order link ID is optional but must be exact if included
  * Do not generate new IDs or modify existing ones

Analysis Requirements:
1. Support/resistance levels and 24h range
2. Technical indicators - EMAs, RSI, MACD, BB
3. Position sizing based on:
   - Current volatility regime
   - ATR-based stop distance
   - Current market phase
   - Setup quality
4. Entry timing and type selection (market/limit)
5. Market structure analysis:
   - Key levels identification
   - Trend strength assessment
   - Volume profile validation
   - Volatility regime analysis
6. Budget analysis:
  - Calculate current budget allocation across positions and orders
  - Consider budget freed by any planned order cancellations
  - Ensure new orders respect remaining available budget

Guidelines for Plan Creation:
1. Each plan must have a unique ID
2. Each new order must have a unique progressive ID starting from 1
3. Each order must be self-contained with its own rationale based on market analysis
4. Order Type Selection:
   - Market Orders (preferred when):
     * Price is within target entry range (Â±0.1% of current price)
     * Quick entry is needed to capture momentum
     * Volume supports immediate execution
     * Risk/reward profile considers automated stop management
   - Limit Orders (preferred when):
     * Targeting specific support/resistance levels
     * Building positions at predefined levels
     * Price expected to reach target in future
     * Current market structure provides clear invalidation levels
   Note: Don't avoid market orders if conditions support immediate entry
5. Set clear market-based invalidation conditions
