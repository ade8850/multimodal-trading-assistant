# VALIDATION

Your response must:
1. Follow the exact JSON schema provided
2. Start and end with curly braces
3. Have properly quoted strings
4. Use ISO format for dates
5. Contain no explanatory text outside the JSON
6. Include cancellations only when necessary
7. Order cancellations must be executed before new orders

Order ID and Link ID Requirements:
- For NEW orders:
  * Each order must have a unique order_link_id
  * Format MUST be: "{plan_id}-{session_id}-{order_number}"
  * Example: For plan_id "{{ plan_id }}", session_id "{{ session_id }}" and first order: "{{ plan_id }}-{{ session_id }}-1"
  * The order_number must match the order's id field
  * Order IDs must be progressive starting from 1
- For CANCELLATIONS:
  * Always copy the exact order ID from the active orders list
  * Order link ID is optional but must be exact if included
  * Do not generate new IDs or modify existing ones

Analysis Requirements:
1. Support/resistance levels and 24h range
2. Technical indicators - EMAs, RSI, MACD, BB
3. Position sizing based on:
   - Current volatility regime
   - ATR-based stop distance
   - Current market phase
   - Setup quality
4. Entry timing and type selection (market/limit)
5. Market structure analysis:
   - Key levels identification
   - Trend strength assessment
   - Volume profile validation
   - Volatility regime analysis
6. Budget analysis:
  - Calculate budget requirement for new entry orders
  - Consider execution types in budget allocation
  - Ensure total allocation respects available budget

Order Execution Requirements:
1. Execution Types:
   - IMMEDIATE: Market orders requiring quick execution
     * Use when immediate entry needed
     * When capturing strong momentum moves
     * Clear invalidation levels identified
   - PASSIVE: Limit orders at specific levels
     * For planned entries at support/resistance
     * When building positions gradually
     * Clear market structure provides entry zones
   - TRIGGER: Conditional execution
     * For breakout trade entries
     * When specific price level must be reached
     * Clear market structure confirmation required

2. Risk Levels:
   - CRITICAL: High priority execution needed
     * Clear invalidation levels
     * Strong momentum conditions
     * High confidence setups
   - NORMAL: Standard execution priority
     * Regular entry orders
     * Standard market conditions
     * Clear but not urgent setups
   - MINIMAL: Can wait for optimal conditions
     * Additional position building
     * Non-critical entries
     * Requires perfect conditions

Strategic Context Requirements:
1. Setup Rationale:
   - Describe the current market setup and technical conditions
   - Explain why this setup is relevant now
   - Highlight key technical confirmations
2. Market Bias:
   - Provide clear directional bias with timeframe context
   - Explain how this bias relates to the setup
3. Key Levels:
   - List critical price levels in order of importance
   - Include both support and resistance levels
   - Focus on levels relevant to the setup
4. Catalysts:
   - List specific market conditions supporting the setup
   - Include both technical and structural catalysts
5. Invalidation Conditions:
   - List specific conditions that would invalidate the setup
   - Focus on measurable market conditions
   - Include both price and structure based invalidations

Order Management Rules:
1. Entry Orders:
   - Focus on entry execution only
   - Each order must have clear invalidation levels
   - Must have valid price for limit orders
   - Must have valid budget > 0
   - Based on current market conditions only
   - Independent from other orders

2. Reduce-Only Orders:
   - Must be market or limit type
   - Must have reduce_only flag set to true
   - Independent from entry orders
   - Not counted in budget calculations
   - Based solely on current analysis
   - Clear trigger conditions required

Guidelines for Plan Creation:
1. Each plan must have a unique ID
2. Each new order must have a unique progressive ID starting from 1
3. Each order must be self-contained with its own rationale based on market analysis
4. Order Type Selection:
   - Market Orders (preferred when):
     * Price is within target entry range (Â±0.1% of current price)
     * Quick entry is needed to capture momentum
     * Volume supports immediate execution
     * Risk/reward profile considers current volatility
   - Limit Orders (preferred when):
     * Targeting specific support/resistance levels
     * Building positions at predefined levels
     * Price expected to reach target in future
     * Current market structure provides clear invalidation levels
   Note: Don't avoid market orders if conditions support immediate entry
5. Set clear market-based invalidation conditions

When Evaluating Existing Orders:
1. Compare current market conditions against original setup
2. Review strategic context for continued validity
3. Evaluate if invalidation conditions have been met
4. Consider cancellation if:
   - Original setup is no longer valid
   - Market structure has significantly changed
   - Invalidation conditions have been met
   - Better opportunities exist within risk parameters
