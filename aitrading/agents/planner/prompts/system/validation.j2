# VALIDATION

Your response must:
1. Follow the exact JSON schema provided
2. Start and end with curly braces
3. Have properly quoted strings
4. Use ISO format for dates
5. Contain no explanatory text outside the JSON
6. Include cancellations only when necessary
7. Order cancellations must be executed before new orders

Order ID and Link ID Requirements:
- For NEW orders:
  * Each order must have a unique order_link_id
  * Format MUST be: "{plan_id}-{session_id}-{order_number}"
  * Example: For plan_id "{{ plan_id }}", session_id "{{ session_id }}" and first order: "{{ plan_id }}-{{ session_id }}-1"
  * The order_number must match the order's id field
  * Order IDs must be progressive starting from 1
- For CANCELLATIONS:
  * Always copy the exact order ID from the active orders list
  * Order link ID is optional but must be exact if included
  * Do not generate new IDs or modify existing ones

Micro-Swing Analysis Requirements:
1. Immediate support/resistance levels with focus on recent structures
2. Technical indicators with emphasis on momentum:
   - EMAs (primary focus on 9, 21 on 15m chart)
   - RSI with attention to first signs of flattening/divergence
   - MACD for early momentum shift detection
   - Bollinger Bands for volatility contraction/expansion phases
3. Position sizing based on:
   - Current volatility regime
   - Short-term price volatility assessment
   - 15m chart pattern quality
   - Proximity to significant levels
4. Entry timing with precise target identification
5. Market structure analysis:
   - Nearest key levels identification (1-3 hour price targets)
   - Early exhaustion pattern recognition
   - Volume profile for confirmation/divergence
   - Indecision candle formations
   - First signs of momentum loss
6. Exit signal recognition:
   - Candlestick reversal patterns
   - Waning momentum indicators
   - Approach to significant levels
   - Volume profile changes
6. Budget analysis:
  - Calculate budget requirement for new entry orders
  - Consider execution types in budget allocation
  - Ensure total allocation respects available budget
  - IMPORTANT: Budget must be specified WITHOUT considering leverage
  - The system will apply leverage when calculating final order quantity

Micro-Swing Order Execution Requirements:
1. Execution Types:
   - IMMEDIATE: Market orders requiring quick execution
     * Use when momentum is clearly established and continuation is likely
     * For quick exits when momentum deteriorates rapidly
     * Clear invalidation levels must be identified
   - PASSIVE: Limit orders at specific levels
     * Preferred method for entries at identified support/resistance levels
     * For precise profit-taking at structural targets
     * Should be set with clear market structure reference points
   - TRIGGER: Conditional execution
     * For breakout confirmations in micro-swing setups
     * When specific price level must be reached to confirm the setup
     * Should trigger within 1-3 hours to be valid for micro-swing approach

2. Risk Levels:
   - CRITICAL: High priority execution needed
     * Clear invalidation levels
     * Strong momentum conditions
     * High confidence setups
   - NORMAL: Standard execution priority
     * Regular entry orders
     * Standard market conditions
     * Clear but not urgent setups
   - MINIMAL: Can wait for optimal conditions
     * Additional position building
     * Non-critical entries
     * Requires perfect conditions

Strategic Context Requirements:
1. Setup Rationale:
   - Describe the current market setup and technical conditions
   - Explain why this setup is relevant now
   - Highlight key technical confirmations
2. Market Bias:
   - Provide clear directional bias with timeframe context
   - Explain how this bias relates to the setup
3. Key Levels:
   - List critical price levels in order of importance
   - Include both support and resistance levels
   - Focus on levels relevant to the setup
4. Catalysts:
   - List specific market conditions supporting the setup
   - Include both technical and structural catalysts
5. Invalidation Conditions:
   - List specific conditions that would invalidate the setup
   - Focus on measurable market conditions
   - Include both price and structure based invalidations

Order Management Rules:
1. Entry Orders:
   - Focus on entry execution only
   - Each order must have clear invalidation levels
   - Must have valid price for limit orders
   - Must have valid budget > 0
   - Budget must be specified WITHOUT leverage (base margin only)
   - Based on current market conditions only
   - Independent from other orders

2. Reduce-Only Orders:
   - Must be market or limit type
   - Must have reduce_only flag set to true
   - Should consider execution timing and price levels to maximize effectiveness
   - Consider existing pending reduce orders when planning new ones
   - Independent from entry orders
   - Not counted in position budget calculations
   - Based solely on current analysis
   - Clear trigger conditions required

Guidelines for Plan Creation:
1. Each plan must have a unique ID
2. Each new order must have a unique progressive ID starting from 1
3. Each order must be self-contained with its own rationale based on market analysis
4. CRITICAL ORDER LIMITS BY TYPE:
   * Only ONE position-increasing order is allowed in the system at any time
   * Only ONE reduce-only order is allowed in the system at any time
   * Position-increasing orders are any orders with reduce_only: false
   * If there are existing position-increasing orders, you MUST either:
     - Cancel existing position-increasing orders before creating a new one, OR
     - Create no new position-increasing orders and retain existing ones
   * If there are existing reduce-only orders, you MUST either:
     - Cancel existing reduce-only orders before creating a new reduce-only order, OR
     - Create no new reduce-only orders and retain existing ones
   * Reduce-only orders and position-increasing orders are managed separately
   * This rule has highest priority and CANNOT be ignored under any circumstances
5. Micro-Swing Order Type Selection:
   - Market Orders (appropriate uses):
     * For ENTRIES: Only when momentum is clearly established with volume confirmation
     * For PROFIT-TAKING: At first clear sign of momentum loss or structure change
     * For REDUCING PROFITABLE POSITIONS: When approaching key levels with hesitation
     * For IMMEDIATE EXITS: When price action shows sudden reversal patterns
     * When holding through the next 15-minute interval represents excess risk
   - Limit Orders (appropriate uses):
     * For ENTRIES: Primary method at key support/resistance levels
     * For TAKE-PROFIT: Set immediately after entry at realistic structural targets
     * For REDUCING PROFITABLE POSITIONS: Place at nearby structural targets
     * For AUTOMATED EXITS: To ensure capturing profits without waiting for next interval
     * When price is expected to reach specific levels within 1-3 hours
   Note: For micro-swing trading, establishing immediate take-profit orders is essential. Do not rely on the system's 15-minute intervals for exits when targets can be predefined.
6. Set clear market-based invalidation conditions

When Evaluating Existing Orders:
1. Compare current market conditions against original setup
2. Review strategic context for continued validity
3. Evaluate if invalidation conditions have been met
4. Consider cancellation if:
   - Original setup is no longer valid
   - Market structure has significantly changed
   - Invalidation conditions have been met
   - Better opportunities exist within risk parameters
