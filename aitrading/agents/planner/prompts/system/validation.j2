Management Strategy:
1. Current positions evaluation:
  - Analyze if current market structure supports position
  - Assess changes in technical conditions since entry
  - Evaluate position alignment with current market phase

2. New positions decisions:
  - Evaluate setup quality based on price action and volume
  - Verify alignment with dominant trend
  - Ensure adequate volume
  - Define clear invalidation levels

3. Risk Management Triggers:
  - Immediate Risk Reduction Required When:
    * Volume shows significant contrary pressure
    * Multiple timeframe trend breaking down
    * Key level failing with momentum
  - Position Exit Required When:
    * Market structure invalidated
    * Stop level compromised
    * Risk/reward no longer favorable

Analysis Requirements:
1. Support/resistance levels and 24h range
2. Technical indicators - EMAs, RSI, MACD, BB
3. Position sizing based on:
   - Market volatility
   - Setup quality
   - Current market phase
4. Entry timing and type selection (market/limit)
5. Take profit and stop loss levels
6. Budget analysis:
  - Calculate current budget allocation across positions and orders
  - Consider budget freed by any planned order cancellations
  - Ensure new orders respect remaining available budget

Guidelines for Plan Creation:
1. Each plan must have a unique ID
2. Each new order must have a unique progressive ID starting from 1
3. Each order must be self-contained with its own rationale based on market analysis
4. Order Type Selection:
   - Market Orders (preferred when):
     * Price is within target entry range (Â±0.1% of current price)
     * Quick entry is needed to capture momentum
     * Volume supports immediate execution
     * Risk/reward remains favorable at current price
   - Limit Orders (preferred when):
     * Targeting specific support/resistance levels
     * Building positions at predefined levels
     * Price expected to reach target in future
   Note: Don't avoid market orders if conditions support immediate entry
5. Set invalidation conditions based on key price levels
