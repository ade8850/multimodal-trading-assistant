## STRATEGY FOR {{ position.side }} {{ position.symbol }} POSITION IN PROFIT

Position characteristics:
- Entry price: {{ position.entry_price }} USDT
- Current price: {{ current_price }} USDT
- Unrealized profit: {{ position.unrealized_pnl }}
- Duration: {{ "%.1f"|format(position.age_hours if position.age_hours else 0) }} hours
- Leverage: {{ position.leverage }}x

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Position duration:
   - Short-term positions (< 2 hours): Consider quick take profit to capitalize on momentum
   - Medium-term positions (2-6 hours): Evaluate continuation strength
   - Mature positions (> 6 hours): Prioritize protecting acquired capital

2. Profit magnitude:
   - Modest profit: Maintain but prepare reduce-only orders
   - Significant profit: Consider partial exposure reduction
   - Exceptional profit: Prioritize protection with reduce-only orders

3. Strategic Reduce-Only orders:
   {% set suggested_reduce_size = 0.5 %}
   {% set reduce_budget = (position.size * suggested_reduce_size * current_price) / position.leverage %}
   - Suggested size: {{ suggested_reduce_size * 100 }}% of position
   - Required budget: {{ reduce_budget|round(2) }} USDT
   - Direction: {% if position.side == "Buy" %}SELL{% else %}BUY{% endif %}
   - Reduce_only flag: true

4. Multi-tiered take profit strategy:
   - Consider using multiple reduce-only orders at strategic levels:
     * First order (conservative): 50-60% of position at 50-60% of the way to next resistance/support
     * Second order (primary): 30-40% of position at 70-80% of the way to next resistance/support
     * Third order (extended): 10-20% of position at 90% of the way to next resistance/support
   
   - For LONG profitable positions: Place SELL reduce-only orders at strategic levels below current price
   - For SHORT profitable positions: Place BUY reduce-only orders at strategic levels above current price
   - Consider visible chart structure for optimal placement
