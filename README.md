# SuperBotAI Trading System

‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK** ‚ö†Ô∏è

SuperBotAI is an experimental AI-powered trading system that leverages multimodal AI capabilities to analyze market charts and create trading strategies. This project demonstrates the potential of AI in automated trading while exploring new approaches to market analysis.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This is an **experimental project** and should not be used for actual trading without thorough testing and understanding of the risks involved. The authors are not responsible for any financial losses incurred through the use of this system.

## üîç Key Features

The system utilizes multimodal AI models to analyze market charts and technical patterns, integrating visual analysis capabilities with automated trading execution. It supports multiple AI providers and includes both a web-based interface for creating individual trading strategies and a scheduler for continuous automated execution.

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with dependency injection architecture
- **AI Models**: 
  - Claude (Anthropic)
  - Gemini Pro Vision (Google)
  - GPT-4 Vision (OpenAI)
- **Trading Interface**: Bybit API (pybit)
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 (not tested with other versions)
- Redis server (required for Streamlit interface only)
- Docker (optional)
- API keys for:
  - Bybit
  - At least one AI provider (Anthropic/Google/OpenAI)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ade8850/superbot-ai-app.git
cd superbot-ai-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

4. Set up scheduler configuration:
```bash
cp scheduler_config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your trading parameters
```

5. Run the application:
```bash
# Web interface
streamlit run app.py

# Scheduler
python scheduler.py
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and run the web interface
docker build -t superbotai .
docker run -p 8501:8501 superbotai

# Build and run the scheduler
docker build -f scheduler.Dockerfile -t superbotai-scheduler .
docker run superbotai-scheduler
```

## üìä How It Works

1. **Market Analysis**:
   - The system uses multimodal AI capabilities to analyze market charts
   - Visual patterns and market context are evaluated using natural language processing

2. **Strategy Generation**:
   - AI models process the visual analysis and market context
   - Trading strategies are generated based on identified patterns

3. **Order Execution**:
   - Strategies are converted into concrete trading orders
   - Orders are executed through the Bybit API

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The system can be configured through:
- Environment variables (.env file)
- Web interface settings
- YAML configuration files for the scheduler (config.yaml)

See `scheduler_config.example.yaml` for scheduler configuration options.
