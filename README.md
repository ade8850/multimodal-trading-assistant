# Multi modal trading assistant

‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is an experimental AI-powered trading system that combines multimodal artificial intelligence with automated risk management. The system analyzes market charts using advanced visual AI capabilities while implementing systematic risk controls through dynamic stop loss management.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This is an **experimental project** and should not be used for actual trading without thorough testing and understanding of the risks involved. The authors are not responsible for any financial losses incurred through the use of this system.

## üîç Key Features

The system combines AI-driven analysis with automated risk management to create a comprehensive trading solution. At its core, the system processes market data in two distinct ways: visual analysis for trade opportunities and systematic risk management for position protection.

The multimodal AI component analyzes market charts and technical patterns to identify potential trading opportunities. This analysis considers multiple timeframes and various technical indicators to form a complete market view.

The automated risk management system implements a dynamic stop loss strategy based on market volatility and position performance. This system adapts protection levels as positions evolve, providing tighter risk control in volatile conditions while allowing profitable trades room to develop.

Additional features include:
- Integration with multiple AI providers (Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4)
- Support for multiple trading pairs and timeframes
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring through Logfire
- Web-based interface for strategy creation and monitoring
- Automated trading scheduler for continuous operation

## üìä Risk Management

The system implements an advanced automated risk management strategy that adapts to market conditions and position performance:

Position Protection:
- Stop losses are calculated using Average True Range (ATR) to account for market volatility
- Protection levels automatically adjust based on position performance
- Two-tiered system provides different ATR multipliers based on whether the position is in profit or not

Risk Bands:
1. Initial Protection Band: Conservative stop loss placement for new positions (not in profit)
2. In Profit Band: Adjusted protection when the stop loss is above the entry price (for long positions) or below the entry price (for short positions)

All risk parameters are fully configurable through the web interface or configuration files, allowing for customization while maintaining systematic risk control.

## üõ† Technology Stack

The system is built using modern Python technologies:

Core Components:
- Python 3.12
- Pydantic for data validation
- Streamlit for web interface
- Plotly for technical analysis charts

Integration Points:
- Bybit API through pybit
- Multiple AI providers supported (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI)
- Primary testing and optimization conducted with **Anthropic's Claude**
- Logfire for structured logging

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 (not tested with other versions)
- Docker (optional)
- API keys for:
  - Bybit
  - At least one AI provider (Anthropic/Google/OpenAI)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ade8850/multimodal-trading-assistant.git
cd multimodal-trading-assistant
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

4. Set up scheduler configuration:
```bash
cp scheduler_config.example.yaml scheduler_config.yaml
# Edit scheduler_config.yaml with your trading parameters
```

5. Run the application:
```bash
# Web interface
streamlit run app.py

# Scheduler
./run_scheduler.sh
```

## üìä How It Works

The system operates through three main phases:

1. Technical Analysis
   - AI models analyze market charts across multiple timeframes
   - Technical patterns and market context are evaluated
   - Key support and resistance levels are identified

2. Decision Making
   - Entry opportunities are identified based on technical analysis
   - Position sizing considers current market volatility
   - Stop loss levels are calculated using ATR-based algorithm

3. Risk Management
   - Positions are continuously monitored
   - Stop losses adjust automatically based on market conditions
   - Protection levels adapt to position performance

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The system can be configured through:
- Environment variables (.env file)
- YAML configuration files (scheduler_config.yaml)
Both trading parameters and risk management settings are fully customizable through these files.
